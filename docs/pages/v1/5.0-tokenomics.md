# Tokenomics

Current plans are to launch BitLend v1 without a governance token.

V2 of the protocol will include a token, titled BLEND, that will feature fee accrual via staking, governance rights, and a ve-boost model.

_Note: The BitLend team is still researching and deciding between traditional ve and ve(3,3) tokenomics. These docs will be updated accordingly prior to launch of v2._&#x20;

Token Ticker: **BLEND**&#x20;

Total Supply: **100M**

&#x20;Initial Circulating Supply: **TBD (up to 3M tokens)**&#x20;
