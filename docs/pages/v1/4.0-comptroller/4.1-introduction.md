# 4.1 Introduction

Similar to the comptroller used by Compound finance, BitLend will utilize a risk-management smart contract. This contract will determine collateral requirements on a user-by-user basis, and if a user can be liquidated. The Comptroller has the ability to approve and deny transactions each time a user interacts with a bToken contract.

More info about the Comptroller contract can be found [here](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/comptroller/).
