# Introduction

Similar to the comptroller used by Compound finance, BitLend will utilize a risk-management smart contract. This contract will determine collateral requirements on a user-by-user basis, and if a user can be liquidated. The Comptroller has the ability to approve and deny transactions each time a user interacts with a bToken contract.

More info about the Comptroller contract can be found [here](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/comptroller/).

# Open Price Feed

The Open Price Feed accounts price data for the Bitlend protocol. The protocolâ€™s Comptroller contract uses it as a source of truth for prices. Price data is updated in real-time by the [Band Standard Dataset](https://docs.bandchain.org/band-standard-dataset/).

The Band Standard Dataset prices are used directly in the Comptroller through the price feed as there is no support for an anchored view.
