# 4.2 Open Price Feed

The Open Price Feed accounts price data for the Bitlend protocol. The protocolâ€™s Comptroller contract uses it as a source of truth for prices. Price data is updated in real-time by the [Band Standard Dataset](https://docs.bandchain.org/band-standard-dataset/).

The Band Standard Dataset prices are used directly in the Comptroller through the price feed as there is no support for an anchored view.
