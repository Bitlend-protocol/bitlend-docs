# Security

Security is an integral part of Bitlendâ€™s vision to provide fast, affordable and secure DeFi on BitTorrent chain. As such, we have taken extensive measures to ensure that the protocol is fully robust prior to launch.&#x20;

The protocol has undergone multiple audits by Peckshield and Oxorio and all identified vulnerabilities have been corrected. We are currently in the midst of a re-audit with Oxorio for a new smart contract.&#x20;

We are also planning a community bug bounty with up to $100k in rewards.
