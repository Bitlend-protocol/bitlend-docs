# Protocol Parameters

Given the current difficult market conditions, BitLend will launch with no more than two lending and borrowing markets. With unique trading activity and liquidity on BTTC, BitLend will use a conservative approach to enabling collateral types and establishing collateral ratios. These parameters will regularly be revised and adjusted as liquidity on BTTC grows.
