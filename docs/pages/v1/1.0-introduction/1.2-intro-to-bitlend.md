# 1.2 Intro to Bitlend

Lending and borrowing platforms are an important part of DeFi. Through supply, demand, and tokenized incentives, crypto lending platforms set the market rate for on-chain passive income. These protocols are often composable, allowing other platforms to build on top of and use their infrastructure to create new products.

BitLend is a permissionless, transparent, and non-custodial lending platform native to BitTorrent Chain. A fork of Compound Finance v2, it will be the first lending and borrowing protocol to launch on BTTC - paving the way for fast and scalable DeFi in the BTTC ecosystem. BitLendâ€™s entire codebase is comprised of Solidity, and will utilize Band price oracles in lieu of Chainlink. More information on Band Protocol can be found here.
