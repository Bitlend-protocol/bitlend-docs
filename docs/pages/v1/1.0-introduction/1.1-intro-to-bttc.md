# 1.1 Intro to BTTC

BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) is the world’s first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol on TRON. It utilizes Proof of Stake technology and side-chains to solve blockchain’s trilemma: scalability, speed, and security.

BitTorrent Chain is interoperable with other mainstream blockchains such as Tron, Ethereum, and Binance Chain. Its underlying protocol has an average block time of 2 to 3 seconds, greatly speeding up transactions. Fees on BTTC average less than $.01, making it one of the most affordable platforms for developers and users alike.

BitTorrent is also the world’s largest peer to peer network. Originally founded in 2004, BitTorrent was founded as a file sharing service. The platform has amassed over 100 million active users, been installed on over 1 billion devices, and is used in 138 countries worldwide.
