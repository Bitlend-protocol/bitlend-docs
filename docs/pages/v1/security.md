# Security

## Introduction

The security of the Bitlend protocol is our highest priority; our development team, alongside third-party auditors and consultants, has invested considerable effort to create a protocol that we believe is safe and dependable. All contract code and balances are publicly verifiable, and security researchers are eligible for a bug bounty for reporting undiscovered vulnerabilities.

We believe that size, visibility, and time are the true test for the security of a smart contract; please exercise caution, and make your own determination of security and suitability.
