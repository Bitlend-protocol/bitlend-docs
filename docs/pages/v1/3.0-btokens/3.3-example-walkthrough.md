# 3.3 Example Walkthrough

Say a user deposits 1000 USDD to BitLend when the exchange rate is .02. That user would receive 50,000 bUSDD (1000 / .02).

After several months, the user decides it is time to withdraw their USDD from the protocol. At that time, the exchange rate is .02158.

The userâ€™s 50000 bUSDD is now equal to 1079 USDD (50000 \* .02158).

The user has the option to redeem all 50000 bUSDD to withdraw all 1079 USDD, or they could remove any portion they choose.
